                <h2>1. Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  At eSIMFly, we strive to provide high-quality eSIM products and excellent customer service. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be granted for eSIM purchases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to the digital nature of eSIM products, refunds are subject to specific conditions detailed below.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>

                <h3>2.1 Eligible for Full Refund</h3>
                <p>You may be eligible for a full refund if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The eSIM has not been installed on any device</li>
                  <li>The eSIM has not been activated</li>
                  <li>No data has been consumed</li>
                  <li>The refund request is made within 30 days of purchase</li>
                  <li>Technical issues on our end prevented delivery of the eSIM</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Not Eligible for Refund</h3>
                <p>Refunds cannot be provided if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The eSIM has been installed on a device (QR code scanned or activation code entered)</li>
                  <li>The eSIM has been activated on a network</li>
                  <li>Any data has been used from the plan</li>
                  <li>The validity period of the eSIM has begun</li>
                  <li>The purchase was made more than 30 days ago</li>
                  <li>The eSIM does not work due to device incompatibility (user responsibility to verify before purchase)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Special Circumstances</h2>

                <h3>3.1 Technical Issues</h3>
                <p>
                  If you experience technical issues with your eSIM that prevent it from working properly, please contact our support team first. We will work to resolve the issue or provide a replacement eSIM before considering a refund.
                </p>

                <h3>3.2 Network Coverage Issues</h3>
                <p>
                  While we partner with reputable carriers, network coverage can vary by location. If you experience persistent coverage issues in an area where coverage was advertised, please contact support with details of your location and issue. Partial refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
                </p>

                <h3>3.3 Duplicate Purchases</h3>
                <p>
                  If you accidentally made a duplicate purchase, please contact us immediately. We will refund the duplicate purchase provided the second eSIM has not been installed or activated.
                </p>

                <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>

                </ol>

                <h2>5. Refund Processing</h2>
                <p>
                  Once your refund request is approved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Credit/Debit Card: 5-10 business days for the refund to appear</li>
                  <li>The refund will be issued to the original payment method</li>
                  <li>You will receive an email confirmation when the refund is processed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Processing times may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Account Credit Option</h2>
                <p>
                  As an alternative to a refund, we may offer account credit that can be used for future eSIM purchases. Account credits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Are processed immediately</li>
                  <li>Never expire</li>
                  <li>Can be used for any destination</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>
                  We encourage customers to contact us directly before initiating a chargeback with their bank or credit card company. We are committed to resolving issues fairly and promptly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Filing a chargeback for a legitimate purchase that does not meet our refund criteria may result in account suspension.
                </p>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified policy.
